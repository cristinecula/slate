# 3rd Party

## Plugins (for 3rd party services such as WordPress and Drupal)

We're constantly adding new libraries for different platforms and products to make it easier for you to get started.

**Widgetic WordPress Plugin** - the official Widgetic Plugin that allows you to create Widgets in the WordPress Admin.


## Integrations (with other platforms such as Wix, uKit)
Through partnerships and direct integrations, we're making widgets available on different platforms.
