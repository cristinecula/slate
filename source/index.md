# Introduction

Welcome to the Widgetic API documentation! Here you will find information on how to integrate with and use the Widgetic API.  The API is still in development and we're trying to make this documentation as user-friendly and example-filled as possible, but please [drop us a line](mailto:support@widgetic.com) with any questions. 

The Widgetic API is architected around REST, using standard HTTP verbs to communicate and HTTP response codes to indicate status and errors. All responses come in standard JSON.

We also provide a Javascript SDK (Widgetic.js) that enables direct communication with the REST API, user authentication and authorization, and advanced manipulation of embedded widgets.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

### Missing Documentation (coming soon):
